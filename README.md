# Conways game of Life


## Rules

<pre>
· Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbor's dies as if caused by under pop
· Any live cell with 2 or more neighbor's will live
· Any live cell with more than 3 neighbor's will die
· any dead cell with 3 live neighbor's becomes live
</pre>

## Goals

<pre>
· The world is represented by a 2D array (10 x 5)
· This 2d array should be represented in the CMD/Terminal as a grid
· Each cell is represented by a “.” for dead and “*” for living
· Initial state or a seed world will need to be used to kick off the life
· Your code should use the seed world to generate the next generation
· Correctly handle cells that start to “go off the board” cells that go off the edge do not get displayed, still model them off the screen but just don't display them
</pre>

## Example

<pre>
Input : ..........
        ...**.....
        ....*.....
        ..........
        ..........

Output: ..........
        ...**.....
        ...**.....
        ..........
        ..........
        ..........
</pre>

## Extras

<pre>
★
· Have the game “tick”, progress a generation with each tick
· Implement a restart (which goes back to initial state)
· Implement a pause (which halts the progression of time)
· Implement a way to go from manual progression to automatic progression

★★
· Instead of providing an entire seed world simply supply a seed pattern/s that can be put down in the centre of the world
· Experiment with the world size / Have the user decide the world size
